Stone.js Browser core provides essential utilities for browser-based applications, including event handling, response management, and cookie operations.

---

## Overview

The `@stone-js/browser-core` package provides the browser-side runtime abstraction for navigation-based applications built with **Stone.js**. It acts as the **client-side continuation** of `@stone-js/http-core`, enabling the same application logic to run across HTTP and browser environments, such as SSR, SPA, and hybrid apps.

This module enables **context-aware event and response handling** in the browser using a unified model of routing, redirection, and cookie control, without managing DOM or UI behavior directly.

## Key Features

- `IncomingBrowserEvent`: Represents navigation-based client-side events (e.g., route changes, link clicks)
- `OutgoingBrowserResponse`: Produces standardized browser responses (HTML updates, cookie headers, etc.)
- `RedirectBrowserResponse`: Emits client-side redirects with full context
- `CookieCollection`: Unified cookie abstraction across HTTP and browser environments
- Designed for **SPA and SSR continuity**, not tied to any frontend library

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package does **not** manage DOM events or UI interactions. It strictly handles navigation-level behavior in a runtime-agnostic way.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stone-js/browser-core
```

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> This package is **pure ESM**. Ensure your `package.json` includes `"type": "module"` or configure your bundler appropriately.

## Usage Example

```ts
import { IncomingBrowserEvent, RedirectBrowserResponse } from '@stone-js/browser-core'

const event = new IncomingBrowserEvent({
  url: URL.parse(location)
})

const response = RedirectBrowserResponse.to('/dashboard')
```
